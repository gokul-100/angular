*angular 
	-it is application and developement platform for creating efficient and sofisticated single page application
    angular works on component and modules

*component
        - it is partial part of angular app
        -it can be any part of application which we can resuse multiple time

node_module:
        -all libarary or dependancy will install in this folder

package.json : it will kepp enrty of  insatall all library or package
package-lock.json: it will hold detail information of insatlled package
readme.md : it will work like guide manual 
gitignore :it use to store file and folder to ignore while push data on github

*app
    -in angular app is root component

*how to create component componentName
    ng generate component componentName
    ng g c componentName

    ng g c components/databinding
    ng g c components/directive

*how to dispaly individual component view or  output
    -copy component selector name from its file and write selector name tag 

*databinding
    accessing data from one file to another in same component
        1.interpolation{()}; ts=>html
        2. property Binding[]; ts => html(here we set attribute value)
        3.event Binding (); html => ts(here we call event)
        4.two way data binding[()]; ts <=> html
         -to perform two way databinding

task: create a componentwith name toggleimg in task folder in which you have to toggle image on single click
how to create component:   ng g c components/componentName

directives:
    it is use to perform dom manipulation(change dom layout) and change appearance and behaviour of dom element
        1.stuctural Directives :it is use to change dom element layout
                                -it is denoted by * symbol
                                -*ngif: it will display dom element when it get true value otherwise not
                                -*ngFor: it is use iterate or repeate dom element
                                -*ngSwitchCase: it is use to display dom element on choice

        2.attribute Directives: it is use to change appearance and behaviour of dom element
                                -ngStyle: it is use to apply css property conditionally
                                -ngclas: it is use to apply css classes conditionally
        3.cutome directives: developer can write logic to create custome directive
                                - to create a custome directive we have a command.
                                -ng generate directive directiveNmae

*pipe -in angular is use  to transform property without changing its original value
        - to use pipe we use | symbol
        - there are three types of pipes
            1.inbuilt pipe - pipe provided by angular
            2.custome pipe : pipe developed by developer for use in projects
            //how to create custome pipe
            ng generate pipe pipeName
            3.third party pipe : pipe developed by third party pipe

*how to use bootstrap in angular
step1: install bootstrap => npm i bootstrap
step2:go to angular.json and import bootstrap file path in style section
        node_module
step3: teriminate the angular project and restart it

note start angular
            1.open angular projects
            2.open command
            3.open in vs code
            4.npx ng s -o

*routing: navigation of component
            -dispaly component output or view by writting its path in browser url.
            -routing will display component output under <router-outlet> <router-outlet>
            -routing is array object containing property with value 
            -in angular root routing module name is app-routing-module.ts

types of routing
    1.naming routing: we write component routing path in browser url to display component output
    2.default routing:display component output by default means ,keep its path value blanck in routing 
                        try to keep default routing first n order,
    3.redirect routing : display component output by writting different  path name
    parameterize routing :passing parameter with path name to dispaly component output
    child routing: define one routijg inside another routing 
                    - for this in parent routing we have to use childern property .
                    -in parent routing component html file 
    4.wildcard routing : display component output ,when user write wrong path in browser url
                        -in this we write * as value in routing path .
                        wildcard routing must last routing ,router define below to it never work

form validation in angular
*in angular there are two ways to perform form validation.
        1. By using Utdf(User template Driven form):
            -when we have to perform simple and small form validation in that case we use utdf.
            -in utdf validation code will in html file
            - in this we use ngModel model directory.
        2.By Using RTF (Reactive template form) :
            -in rtf validation perform in its file.
            -to rtf validation first we have to perform form validation in that case we use rtf 
            -rtf validation we use two classes
                1.form group:it will hold call formcontrol date in it as well as it tract status of form 
                2.formControl: it will track status and validation of individual input control

                States	           Class if true	          Class if false
The control has been visited.	   ng-touched	             ng-untouched
The control's value has changed.	ng-dirty	              ng-pristine
The control's value is valid.	    ng-valid	              ng-invalid

step: import REactive forms module in root module(app.module.ts) from formsModule
step2:import formGroup and formcontrol class in rtf component

*service ; inangular service is special class with extra power
            -we can share data with multiple component
            -we can implement bussiness logic in it
            -we can perform external communication (fetch data from server).

To create service=> npx ng service serviceName

how to access service data into any commponent.
        -to accessdata from service to component constructor we have to create insatnce of service class  then we can access data into component.

        -creating service class instance in component constructor is called dependanccy is called

*how to install create REST fake app
        dummy server : json -server
        database: json database

        to install json server:
           npm i -g json -server
        database :json database

        *how to upload db.json file on json-server
        cd src /app/shared/databases (press enter)
        json -server --watch -p 8888 db.json (press enter)

        *to make request from service to server we have to create instance of httpclient class in service. but httpClient is not part of core angular.it is part of httpClientModule. for this first we have to import httpClientModule in our root module

        *to make request from service we have to create instance of Httpclient class in service constructor
